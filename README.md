# Social Network build with Django

By following the tutorials on [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) I have successfully build a social network with Django.

Users are able to post and see their own dweets, as well the dweets of users that they are following.

Users can easily follow and unfollow other users.

The project has strengthened my understanding of relationships between Django models and showed me how to use forms so that users can interact with my app and with each other. 

I have additionally used the Bulma CSS framework to make my site look good.

The network includes a page for viewing all profiles:

The users can also view their profiles:
